# Various Code Snippets

Here is a repo that I keep all the "useless" code snippets I had the time to document
It has been eight years since I have first started coding
I am still on the path to become a Professional Software Engineer (I'm taking my time)

- This repo is somewhat of a personal "Code Cookbook"
- This reope will contain various programming notes throughout my career 

Tasks
- TODO: Archive Old Code from College Days
- TODO: Prune/Refactor The Code

## My Own Code - Essay

What is the value of the code I write?

"To write good code, one must first write bad code", *Some Programmer I Respect*

"ABC - 'Always Be Coding'", *Random Programmers*

- I undestand that much of the work here id derivative (much of the code here have been taken from much more elegant solutions)
- Most of the code here serves as scratch work (helps get the rust off)
- The repo itself is a memory tool
- I can potentially write APIs for the algorithms that I come up with here, create a library where I can access code from anywhere (Solution: Docker Containers that executes from anywhere)

## My Career As A Hack

I acknowledge that much of the work I have done as a younger programmer, was done as a hack. I was at a point a novice, who is just trying thins for the hell of it. Much of my work is a compilation of hacks. Thus, I can comfortaly call myself a hackjob.
job.

- I still have a feeling that much of the work was wrought with an investment of blood, sweet, and tears...
- Overdramatized (for sure), but I do think that CS can get somewhat mentally challenging.

I hope that this codebase is a good starting point for future work down the road.

## Motivations

The motivation for any type of project like this is to create an archival system. The reason is as simple as me wanting to same time and energy recalling various code snippets.

- I am resigned to the fact that my memory and ability will dull over the years - hopefully this project will buffer the decline when I am on the downslope

- I do not want to time I have invested into coding to go to waste

## Personal Account/Philosophy on Valuing Time

I acknowledge that if I were to really treasure every moment of my life, I would act awfully like a fool...
Yet, I recall the first forays I took into the world of CS - the memories are quite vivid.
Understanding Linux and Bash was quite intimidating... it was really different from Windows/Mac. I have since adapted. Those first steps (the code I was writing back then) surely informs my career/life. I will have to say that I made a poor attempt at documenting the work I did.

So this repo, is an attempt at capturing my work as a programmer. The catch and paradox of this approach: By valuing the present moment, I may start seeing the tree before noticing the forest. Rather, I fear I will pay attention to only the road-signs rather than the scenery.

## The Role of Celebration

I remember my initial hesitancy towards "coding"... there was so much to learn and so many approaches to take that it was quite overwhelming. I thought that getting started with always a struggle. I consider myself have suffered from a form of paralysis.

I tend to suffer from paralysis - A major issues: not knowing the best way to approach code.
Analyzing this on some levels, I believe that the best way to approach paralysis is "celebration"...

- On an abstract level this idea connects to historical reasons as to why people party/celebrate.
- I am personally able to wrap up (to completion) my previous work by celebrating my accomplishments.
- This act opens up the way for future endeavors.
