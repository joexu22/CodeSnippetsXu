# Image Sharpening Idea
Research Idea Relating to Image Sharpening - AKA CSI Miami - Zoom In
The Purposal is to take TONS & TONS & TONS of high resolution photos and blur them
	Compress High Resolution Photos
	Take the Compress Image and try to sharpen it back, using the original image as the Base Mark
	Through Successive generations one should be able to do Zoom In Enhance...
	[Obviously, the generated image would not actually represent true images (fake "artistic" rendering)]
	[BUT, it would essentially make a cool Zoom In tool]

# Personal Application

Personally want to do some style-transfers
Using this paticular method, resolution would not be too much of an issue...

# Likely Have Great Application Towards Computer Doodle Projects
Doodles Can Really Be Upscaled
